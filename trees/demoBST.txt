Binary Trees
Binary Tree Properties

Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, filled from left to right.
Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree where all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.


                        Binary Tree Traversals
In-order Traversal:
    Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, then traverse the right subtree.

Pre-order Traversal:
    Visit the root, then traverse the left subtree and right subtree.

Post-order Traversal:
    Traverse the left subtree, right subtree, and then visit the root.

Level-order Traversal:
    Traverse nodes level by level, starting from the root.
